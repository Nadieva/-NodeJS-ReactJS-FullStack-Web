I put in practice my JavaScript skills thanks to a Udemy tutorial.
**Note: Please go to https://afternoon-hamlet-17159.herokuapp.com to see my application in production. For safety reasons, the development cannot be used because the email is not visible in public website such as GitHub.**

## Goal
This application was built to send surveys by email where the sendee can answer to it in their email message. The administrator can log in and see the results  of all feedbacks.

### Technologies used:

- [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.developers.google.com)
- [Sendergrid](https://sendgrid.com/) to send the feedback by email and track them
- [Mongo DB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) for the database
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for the deployment 

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
